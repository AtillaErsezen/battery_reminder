# battery_reminder
My personal python script that reminds me of the remaining battery just before shutting down the computer. Useful for lectures, helps determine when do I need to charge my laptop so I don't end up with a dead battery during lectures. It uses keyboard library to listen for alt_f4 keys (simple approach, because by habit, I always shut down computer with this combination and nothing else.) It uses psutil to gather the battery information. And it uses tkinter to show the percentage on a window. Since it listens for alt_f4 keys, if we use these combination in somewhere else, ex. when shutting down another application, the window appears, but this isn't considered to be an issue as it can be easily ignored.
